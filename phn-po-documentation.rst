=======================================

User Documentation
------------------

The PMHC MDS online User Documentation provides MDS users with online guidance
on how to navigate and use the MDS once they have been granted access and assigned
user roles at an organisation in the MDS.

Go to the `User Documentation </projects/user-documentation/>`__

PMHC MDS Data Specifications
----------------------------

The :ref:`data-specifications` documentation site defines what data items are
collected in the PMHC MDS, what file formats are accepted for upload and associated
reporting requirements.

Ongoing questions and answers
-----------------------------

`The ongoing questions and answers document <projects/user-documentation/en/latest/faqs/concepts-processes/>`__
provides the Department's responses to issues raised by PHNs
about the PMHC MDS. It will be updated regularly as new issues are raised by
PMHC MDS users.

Guidance on client consent
--------------------------

`The guidance on client consent </doc/pmhc-consent-guidance-D16-1362220.pdf>`__ provides suggested wording that PHNs may
wish to include in client consent forms provided to referrers and
providers to obtain consent from their clients for anonymised data to be
supplied to the PHN and the Department of Health for statistical purposes in
planning and improving mental health services.

Outcome measures and scoring rules
----------------------------------

The following documents provide examples of each of the outcome measures and an
explanation of how they are scored.

* `Kessler 10+ (K10+) </doc/pmhc-scoring-k10p.pdf>`__

Outcome Measures Self Service System
------------------------------------

The `OMSSS <https://docs.omsss.online/>`__ is an online service funded by the Australian Government 
Department of Health and Aged Care (the department) as part of the Primary Mental Health Care 
Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). It allows clients of PHN-commissioned mental health services to 
complete the standardised measures mandated in the PMHC MDS and have the results reported 
back to their service providers.

Overview of purpose, design, scope and key decision issues
----------------------------------------------------------

`The overview paper </doc/pmhc-mds-overview.pdf>`__ is a historical document that outlines the approach taken
in the design of the PMHC MDS and associated reporting arrangements.

Service Provider Quick Reference Guide
--------------------------------------

The Primary Mental Healthcare Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) Service Provider QUICK
REFERENCE Guide is a resource intended to describe key issues and concepts related to the collection of, and provision of data to, the PMHC MDS for mental health service providers. For
more detailed information regarding the PMHC MDS, see the :ref:`data-specifications`.

There are two versions of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide:

* If you are a service provider, it is recommended that you use the 
  `PDF version of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide </doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide.pdf>`__` 
  produced by the Department of Health.
* If you are a Primary Health Network, you can use the 
  `Word version of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide </doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-template.docx>`__` 
  to tailor some of the information to your local context.
