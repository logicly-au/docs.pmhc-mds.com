Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care  (DoHAC) has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to support commissioning of mental health and suicide
prevention services.

The `Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) <https://www.pmhc-mds.com>`__ provides the basis for PHNS, their
service providers and DoHAC to monitor and report on the quantity and quality of service delivery,
and to inform future improvements in the planning and funding of primary mental health care services
funded by the Australian Government.

The PMHC MDS is used by a range of users. We have grouped information that is relevant to
assist the different types of users to find resources.
