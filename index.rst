Meta Download format
--------------------

The Data Extract tab includes a checkbox to include data from all specifications.
This downloads a file that is a combination of all the extensions listed above.
The resulting file *cannot* be uploaded. This is a download
only format. It is based on the most recent version used by either the core
specification or an extension.
